Benchmark for correctness and efficiency of solution to static subtask of original problem.

Problem:
Given set S of N parabolas f_i(x) = a_i x^2 + b_i x + c_i and Q queries of type: given x, what is min{f(x) | f Ñ” S} ?

Test data looks like:
N Q
a1 b1 c1
a2 b2 c2 
...
a_N b_N c_N
x1
x2
...
xQ

Files:
1. StaticGenerator.cpp - generator of random test data. Each parabola and each query is choosen uniformly at random with coefficient is range [-C; C] for some number C. One need to pass N Q C seed to this file.
2. StaticNaive.cpp - naive solution to given problem.
3. StaticSolution.cpp - implementation of proposed algorithm.
4. StaticCorrectness.sh - bash script to generate big number of tests and check whether StaticNaive.cpp and StaticSolution.cpp give same result.
5. StaticEfficiency.sh - bash script to generate big tests and check how fast are both naive and proposed solutions.

One can assure on practice that complexity of proposed algorithm is indeed O(N^2 + Q log N) by, for example, running it on test with N = 5000, Q = 1000000 (C and seed can be any numbers) and see that it works as expected.
