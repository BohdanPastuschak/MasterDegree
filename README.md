Modification of segment tree to online adding parabola to set and minimum at point query.

There are the following folders:
1) Static - codes with solution to static problem and benchmark for its correctness and efficiency.
2) Dynamic - codes with segment tree solution to dynamic problem and benchmark for its correctness.
3) Experiments - four experiments, described in thesis, which check efficiency of segment tree solution to dynamic problem.
