Given initially empty set S of parabolas, one need to proceed the following queries:
1) Add parabola f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c to S
2) Given t, find minimum over parabolas f in S value f(t)

For simplicity, let's assume that all a, b, c, t will be integers in range [0, N).
In can be shown that algorithm can be slightly modified to do same thing with any real numbers instead.
We will show how to proceed second query in O(log N) and first query in T(N), where T(N) will be proven
to be O(N^0.7) (possibly better constrains can be proven too).
